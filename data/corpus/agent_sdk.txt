Agent SDK mini-architecture

An agent loop often follows: plan → choose tool → execute → observe → iterate → finalize.

Key concepts:
- Tool registry: a catalog of tools the agent is allowed to call.
- Permissions: each tool may be allowed or denied (e.g., file access).
- Structured outputs: tools and LLM outputs should be validated with schemas.
- Tracing: capture each step, tool call, tool output, and timing.
